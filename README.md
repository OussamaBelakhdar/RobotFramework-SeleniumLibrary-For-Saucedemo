# RobotFramework-SeleniumLibrary-For-Saucedemo
This repository contains an example of automated testing using Robot Framework and SeleniumLibrary. The test cases provided demonstrate various authentication scenarios on the www.saucedemo.com website.

## Prerequisites
To run the tests in this repository, you need to have the following software installed:
- Python (3.6 or later)
- Robot Framework
- SeleniumLibrary
- Chrome browser (or another browser of your choice)
You can install Robot Framework and SeleniumLibrary using the following command:

pip install robotframework
pip install robotframework-seleniumlibrary
## Getting Started
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the repository's directory.
## Running the Tests
To run the test cases that cover various authentication scenarios on www.saucedemo.com:

robot saucedemo.robot
This command will execute the test cases and open a Chrome browser to perform the automation.

## Test Descriptions
The saucedemo.robot file contains test cases that cover different authentication scenarios on the www.saucedemo.com website. The scenarios covered include:

-  authentication
- Authentication with an empty username and password
- Authentication with an empty username and password
- Authentication with a blocked user
Each test case demonstrates the respective scenario by interacting with the relevant elements on the page and verifying the expected outcomes.

## Notes
The selectors (e.g., ${URL}, ${VALID_USERNAME}, ${VALID_PASSWORD}) in the saucedemo.robot file are used to configure the test cases. Make sure to adjust them according to your test environment.
This example covers a basic set of authentication scenarios. You can expand the test cases to cover additional scenarios or enhance the test suite with more advanced scenarios.
Feel free to customize and enhance the provided test cases to fit your testing needs.

Feel free to customize the README as needed to accurately represent your code and testing scenario.
